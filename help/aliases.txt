Description:
  Sometimes you might have a project associated to a platform but then realize the same
  structure, paths, etc, can apply to different other platforms.
  This is where aliases come into help. You can alias a specific platform to an existing
  one without the need of copying again the same nodes structure.

  Here is an example:

    {
      "project":"Gantry",
      "aliases":[
        {
          "joomla25":"joomla17"
        }
      ],

      "platforms":{
        "joomla17":{
          "nodes":{
            "com_gantry":[{...}, {...}, {...}],
            "library":[{...}],
            "plg_system_gantry":[{...}]
          }
        }
      }
    }
