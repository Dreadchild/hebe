Usage: %{app} edit <project[s]> [+plat[form] <platform[s]>]

Description:
  Opens in the configured editor the specified projects. If no Platform is specified,
  Hebe will try to add all of the platforms associated to the project[s] and if the
  editor allows it, they will all show up.

Arguments:
  <project[s]>   One or many projects you want to open in your editor.
                 The editor can be configured through ~/.hebe/config and if
                 the editor allows it, multiple directories will be added to
                 a new window.
                 You can also export your editor via terminal like:
                    $ export EDITOR="/usr/local/bin/subl -w"
                 Or you can edit your .bash_profile and add the entry in there.
                 To use your exported EDITOR, Hebe config should be configured like:
                    {
                       ...
                       "editor": "$EDITOR",
                       ...
                    }

                 An example of editor could be:
                    {
                       ...
                       "editor": "/usr/local/bin/subl",
                       ...
                    }

  [+plat[form]   Platform argument is optional. When no specified, all the platforms
                 associated to the project will be tried to get added to your editor.
                 You can also specify a specific platform if needed.

                 Examples:

                     1. %{app} edit gantry // All Joomla15, Joomla17, Wordpress platforms
                                           // are added to a new window of your editor
                     2. %{app} edit gantry +platform joomla15
                     3. %{app} edit gantry halcyon +platform joomla16
