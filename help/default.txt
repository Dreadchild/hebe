Commands:
  help          Shows the help informations of a specific command.

  register      Registers a project into Hebe based on the manifest (hebe.json).
                Multiple paths or manifests are allowed as arguments.

  unregister    Unregister one or multiple projects from Hebe.

  list          List all the registered projects in Hebe, with the ability to
                filter by string or regexp.

  sync          Synchronize the projects by re-registering the manifests. With the
                options '+update' the projects will get SVN updated first.

  link          Link one or multiple projects to a specific destination (can be
                multiple at one time). Link command autodetects the platform of
                a destination (ie, joomla15, joomla25, wordpress) and because of
                that there is no need to specify a platform. Although a
                '+platform' option can be use to force a desired platform.

  version       Shows the current version of the App.

  edit          Opens in the configured editor the specified projects. If no
                Platform is specified, Hebe will try to add all of the platforms
                associated to the project[s] and if the editor allows it, they
                will all show up.

  aliases       Description and examples about aliases. Aliases help keeping simple
                the need of adding new platforms without the need of having to copy
                the nodes/structure again.

  update        If Hebe has been checked out, update will perform an SVN UPDATE
                and update the app to its latest revision.

  version       Shows Hebe's version. Hebe versioning system is simply based on
                SVN revision.
