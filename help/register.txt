Usage: %{app} register <dir[s]>|<manifest> [+name <custom_name>] [+force]

Description:
  Registers a project into Hebe based on the manifest (hebe.json). Multiple paths
  or manifests are allowed as arguments.

Arguments:
  <dir[s]>   Directory or directories in which the project reside. In this case
             Hebe will look for a hebe.json inside <dir>.

  <manifest> Manifest file to use. In this case the directory in which the
             manifest file resides will be used as project directory.
             The default manifest is 'hebe.json'.

  [+name]    Allows to register a project customizing its name. Useful if you have
             a branch or a temporary project that you don't want to merge with the
             original project.

             Example:

                %{app} register /project/rokcommon/hebe.json +name RokCommonTest

  [+force]   If a project has already been registered, you can force to be
             registered again in which case will be removed and readded.
