Usage: %{app} link <project[s]> +dest[ination] <path[s]> [+platform <platform>] [+force]

Description:
  Link one or multiple projects to a specific destination (can be multiple at
  one time). Link command autodetects the platform of a destination (ie,
  joomla15, joomla17, wordpress) and because of that there is no need to specify
  a platform. Although a '+platform' option can be use to force a desired
  platform.

Arguments:
  <project[s]>    One or multiple projects that are desired to be linked.

  +dest[ination]  One or multiple paths where the projects will be linked to.
                  This is usually a root site folder like joomla or wordpress.

                  Examples:

                     1. %{app} link gantry +destination ~/Sites/joomla/j15
                     2. %{app} link gantry halcyon +dest ~/Sites/wp/halcyon

  [+platform]     When a project has multiple platforms, you can decide to
                  pick one. When platform is specified, it will override the
                  auto-detection.

                  By default Hebe will try to auto-detect the platform of the
                  destinations and if not found will fallback to the 'custom'
                  platform.
                  If 'custom' will not be found still, then it will error out.

                  Examples:

                     1. %{app} link gantry +destination ~/Sites/joomla/j15 +platform joomla15
                     2. %{app} link gantry halcyon +dest ~/Sites/wp/halcyon +platform wordpress
