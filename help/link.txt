Usage: %{app} link <project[s]> +d[est[ination]] <path[s]> [+p[lat[form]] <platform>] [+force] [+name <name> (works only on Custom)]

Description:
  Link one or multiple projects to a specific destination (can be multiple at
  one time). Link command autodetects the platform of a destination (ie,
  joomla15, joomla25, wordpress) and because of that there is no need to specify
  a platform. Although a '+platform' option can be use to force a desired
  platform.

Arguments:
  <project[s]>       One or multiple projects that are desired to be linked.

  [+d[est[ination]]] One or multiple paths where the projects will be linked to.
                     This is usually a root site folder like joomla or wordpress.

                     Examples:

                        1. %{app} link gantry +destination ~/Sites/joomla/j15
                        2. %{app} link gantry halcyon +d ~/Sites/wp/halcyon

                     Note:
                        1. You can also omit to specify the prefix +d/est/ination
                           Hebe will automatically check for paths existances and
                           fix it for you.

                           Example:

                              %{app} link gantry ~/Sites/Gantry


                        2. The destination can be omitted and the current path will be
                           used as destination. Although it is highly reccomended to always
                           specify a destination. Relying on the current location, in
                           conjunction with a `+platform`, might cause unwanted links.

                           Example:

                              [w00fz@Aton ~/Sites/Gantry]$ %{app} link gantry


  [+p[lat[form]]]    When a project has multiple platforms, you can decide to
                     pick one. When platform is specified, it will override the
                     auto-detection.

                     By default Hebe will try to auto-detect the platform of the
                     destinations and if not found will fallback to the 'custom'
                     platform.
                     If 'custom' will not be found still, then it will error out.

                     Examples:

                        1. %{app} link gantry +destination ~/Sites/joomla/j15 +platform joomla15
                        2. %{app} link gantry halcyon +d ~/Sites/wp/halcyon +p wordpress

  [+name <name>]     Allows to give a custom name to a project of type Custom.
