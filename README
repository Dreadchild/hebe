Welcome to Hebe!

First steps:
   The first thing you want to do after you have checked out anywhere you want Hebe,
   is to register and link Hebe itself.

   1. To register Hebe, change directory to the root level of the Hebe project and
      perform the following command:

      $ ./hebe register .

      If all goes right you should get this message:

        Project `Hebe` updated.
           └ added: Custom

   2. The next step would be to link Hebe to a global binary folder such as /usr/bin.
      To do so perform the following command:

      $ sudo ./hebe link +dest /usr/bin

      The sudo might be required to link to that particular path. A password will be
      asked, just use your USER password and hit enter.

      If all goes right you should get this message:


        Linking projects into `/usr/bin`
           └ Hebe [custom]
             └ hebe: ok

   3. You are now ready to use hebe command anywhere and not just from the hebe project
      folder. That means you no longer needs to CD into Hebe and do a './hebe <command>' but
      from wherever you are you can just use 'hebe <command>'.

   4. Projects and Config files are located under your home directory: ~/.hebe/config and
      ~/.hebe/projects. You can manually edit those to make any change you need.


Enjoy Hebe!
